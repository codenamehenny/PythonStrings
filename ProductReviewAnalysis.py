#Task 1: Keyword Highlighter
#Write a program that searches through reviews list and looks for keywords such as "good", "excellent", "bad", "poor", and "average". 
# We want you to capitalize those keywords then print out each review. 
# Print out each review with the keywords in uppercase so they stand out.

reviews = [
        "This product is really good. I'm impressed with its quality.",
        "The performance of this product is excellent. Highly recommended!",
        "I had a bad experience with this product. It didn't meet my expectations.",
        "Poor quality product. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",
        "The product was average. Nothing extraordinary about it."
    ]
# keywords placed in list

# call function and pass through reviews list and feedback list
uppercase_review = uppercase_feedback(reviews, feedback)

#displays updated reviews with the capitallized keywords
for review in uppercase_review:

# Task 2 Sentiment Tally
# Develop a function that tallies the number of positive and negative words in each review.  
# The function should return the total count of positive and negative words.

#Task 3: Review Summary
#Implement a script that takes the first 30 characters of a review and appends "â€¦" to create a summary. 
#Ensure that the summary does not cut off in the middle of a word.

def summarize_review(reviews):
    max_length =  30
    if len(review) <= max_length: #displays full review if under 30 characters
        return print(review)

        if review[max_length] != " ":
            space = review.find(" ", max_length) #finds where the word ends after 30 mark
            short_review = review[max_length:space] #characters between 30 mark and next space
            final_review = review[:max_length] + short_review + "..." #adds remaining words to the 30 mark and puts "..." at the end
            return print(final_review)
        
# loops through each review and calls the summary function
for review in reviews:
    summaries = summarize_review(reviews)
